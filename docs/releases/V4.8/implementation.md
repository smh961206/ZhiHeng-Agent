# V4.8 Implementation Plan

## Release goal
Move all real LLM requests behind a legacy-compatible Model Gateway; add capability profiles, dry-run policy, telemetry and safe Main→Pro escalation without changing research rules.

## Sequence
## V4.8.0 — LLM inventory + Model Catalog

### Objective
Scan all model calls; define ModelProfile and legacy analysis/vision profiles. Runtime unchanged.

### Required implementation discipline
- Inspect current equivalent modules before creating new files.
- Prefer additive/compatible changes.
- Add/adjust tests at this step.
- Keep the repository runnable before moving to the next subrelease.
- Do not implement later subrelease behavior early unless it is a pure compatible prerequisite.

### Stop condition
This subrelease is complete only when its tests pass and no owning invariant is weakened.
## V4.8.1 — Gateway client/adapters

### Objective
Add canonical complete() API, response/error normalization; reuse model-stream.

### Required implementation discipline
- Inspect current equivalent modules before creating new files.
- Prefer additive/compatible changes.
- Add/adjust tests at this step.
- Keep the repository runnable before moving to the next subrelease.
- Do not implement later subrelease behavior early unless it is a pure compatible prerequisite.

### Stop condition
This subrelease is complete only when its tests pass and no owning invariant is weakened.
## V4.8.2 — Call-site migration

### Objective
Migrate agent/review/followup/research-path/vision and any other real calls behind Gateway. Legacy mode.

### Required implementation discipline
- Inspect current equivalent modules before creating new files.
- Prefer additive/compatible changes.
- Add/adjust tests at this step.
- Keep the repository runnable before moving to the next subrelease.
- Do not implement later subrelease behavior early unless it is a pure compatible prerequisite.

### Stop condition
This subrelease is complete only when its tests pass and no owning invariant is weakened.
## V4.8.3 — Complexity + dry-run policy

### Objective
Add pure complexity evaluator and RoutingDecision. Execution still uses legacy model.

### Required implementation discipline
- Inspect current equivalent modules before creating new files.
- Prefer additive/compatible changes.
- Add/adjust tests at this step.
- Keep the repository runnable before moving to the next subrelease.
- Do not implement later subrelease behavior early unless it is a pure compatible prerequisite.

### Stop condition
This subrelease is complete only when its tests pass and no owning invariant is weakened.
## V4.8.4 — Telemetry + health

### Objective
ModelCall usage/latency/cost-if-known, provider cooldown, same-tier fallback semantics.

### Required implementation discipline
- Inspect current equivalent modules before creating new files.
- Prefer additive/compatible changes.
- Add/adjust tests at this step.
- Keep the repository runnable before moving to the next subrelease.
- Do not implement later subrelease behavior early unless it is a pure compatible prerequisite.

### Stop condition
This subrelease is complete only when its tests pass and no owning invariant is weakened.
## V4.8.5 — Main/Pro escalation

### Objective
Profile pinning, safe checkpoint-based escalation, modelState in new checkpoints, old checkpoint→legacy mapping.

### Required implementation discipline
- Inspect current equivalent modules before creating new files.
- Prefer additive/compatible changes.
- Add/adjust tests at this step.
- Keep the repository runnable before moving to the next subrelease.
- Do not implement later subrelease behavior early unless it is a pure compatible prerequisite.

### Stop condition
This subrelease is complete only when its tests pass and no owning invariant is weakened.
## V4.8.6 — Benchmark + policy rollout

### Objective
Compare legacy baseline vs policy; enable policy only behind config after gates.

### Required implementation discipline
- Inspect current equivalent modules before creating new files.
- Prefer additive/compatible changes.
- Add/adjust tests at this step.
- Keep the repository runnable before moving to the next subrelease.
- Do not implement later subrelease behavior early unless it is a pure compatible prerequisite.

### Stop condition
This subrelease is complete only when its tests pass and no owning invariant is weakened.


## Cross-cutting requirements
- Preserve resume/recovery.
- Preserve evidence safety.
- Preserve point-in-time behavior.
- Preserve existing financial formulas unless this release explicitly owns a formula version change.
- Every persistent schema change requires migration and rollback documentation.
