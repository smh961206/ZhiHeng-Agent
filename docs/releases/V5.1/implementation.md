# V5.1 Implementation Plan

## Release goal
Optimize effective task cost only after capability/quality/health gates and introduce bounded research budgets.

## Sequence
## V5.1.0 — Pricing registry

### Objective
Effective-dated pricing; unknown price=null.

### Required implementation discipline
- Inspect current equivalent modules before creating new files.
- Prefer additive/compatible changes.
- Add/adjust tests at this step.
- Keep the repository runnable before moving to the next subrelease.
- Do not implement later subrelease behavior early unless it is a pure compatible prerequisite.

### Stop condition
This subrelease is complete only when its tests pass and no owning invariant is weakened.
## V5.1.1 — Effective task cost

### Objective
Aggregate retries/review/tool-loop effects, not API sticker price only.

### Required implementation discipline
- Inspect current equivalent modules before creating new files.
- Prefer additive/compatible changes.
- Add/adjust tests at this step.
- Keep the repository runnable before moving to the next subrelease.
- Do not implement later subrelease behavior early unless it is a pure compatible prerequisite.

### Stop condition
This subrelease is complete only when its tests pass and no owning invariant is weakened.
## V5.1.2 — Cache analytics

### Objective
Prefix fingerprint hashes and observed cache ratios.

### Required implementation discipline
- Inspect current equivalent modules before creating new files.
- Prefer additive/compatible changes.
- Add/adjust tests at this step.
- Keep the repository runnable before moving to the next subrelease.
- Do not implement later subrelease behavior early unless it is a pure compatible prerequisite.

### Stop condition
This subrelease is complete only when its tests pass and no owning invariant is weakened.
## V5.1.3 — Cost router

### Objective
Eligible models only after quality/health gates.

### Required implementation discipline
- Inspect current equivalent modules before creating new files.
- Prefer additive/compatible changes.
- Add/adjust tests at this step.
- Keep the repository runnable before moving to the next subrelease.
- Do not implement later subrelease behavior early unless it is a pure compatible prerequisite.

### Stop condition
This subrelease is complete only when its tests pass and no owning invariant is weakened.
## V5.1.4 — Research budget

### Objective
Max model cost/tool rounds/web requests/vision pages/duration.

### Required implementation discipline
- Inspect current equivalent modules before creating new files.
- Prefer additive/compatible changes.
- Add/adjust tests at this step.
- Keep the repository runnable before moving to the next subrelease.
- Do not implement later subrelease behavior early unless it is a pure compatible prerequisite.

### Stop condition
This subrelease is complete only when its tests pass and no owning invariant is weakened.
## V5.1.5 — Information-priority integration

### Objective
When budget tight, preserve critical claims and cut low-value retrieval first.

### Required implementation discipline
- Inspect current equivalent modules before creating new files.
- Prefer additive/compatible changes.
- Add/adjust tests at this step.
- Keep the repository runnable before moving to the next subrelease.
- Do not implement later subrelease behavior early unless it is a pure compatible prerequisite.

### Stop condition
This subrelease is complete only when its tests pass and no owning invariant is weakened.


## Cross-cutting requirements
- Preserve resume/recovery.
- Preserve evidence safety.
- Preserve point-in-time behavior.
- Preserve existing financial formulas unless this release explicitly owns a formula version change.
- Every persistent schema change requires migration and rollback documentation.
